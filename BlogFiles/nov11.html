        <p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0" target="_blank">this video</a> to get a better understanding of useState.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Realized in his same code he had empty angle brackets as the parent element - didn't know you could do that!</li>
            <li>React hooks can't be called conditionally, they have to be called in the same order every time</li>
            <li>They can't be nested in functions or loops either</li>
            <li>useState returns two values, the first is the state, and the second should be the function that updates the state:</li>
            <li><code><pre>const [count, setCount] = useState()</pre></code></li>
            <li>Functions that call setCount will update count</li>
            <li>If you want to update count based on its previous value, pass it as a parameter before updating it</li>
            <li><pre><code>function decrement() {
                setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1);
            }
            </code></pre></li>
            <li>Above will decrement count by 2. Not very intuitive.</li>
            <li>Whenever count is </li>
            <li>useState can also take a function, which runs once.</li>
            <li>When one part of a state is updated, the entire thing is overwritten. Spreading it avoids this issue.</li>
            <li>Using multiple useState hooks makes it easier to manage</li>
        </ul>
