        <p>What I found most helpful for learning in this course was the code samples from the textbooks. The labs were
            also helpful, but I wasn't always able to complete them by the end of class, and accessing the code from my
            personal computers is difficult, as there is no easy way to copy from stu. I think it would have helped if
            the solutions were posted after each lab was due, as that would help with catching up for the next lab and
            for doing the projects.</p>
        <p>Slack is also useful, though it doesn't have an anonymity option like Piazza does (as far as I know), and
            I get intimidated posting questions when everyone reading knows it's me. If I was teaching the class,
            I would probably use Piazza instead. Slack is also kind of slow to load, at least on my computers.</p>
        <p>The peer reviews on the projects were a good touch, though I think if I were to teach the course, I'd give
            more instruction on how the peer reviews should be written, with more focus on criticism. People mostly
            seemed
            to compliment my projects and didn't give me a lot of pointer on stuff I should fix. Though that might
            just be because that's how people review stuff in general and not because of the lack of instruction.</p>
        <p>I'd also allow lorem ipsum text on project1 so less time is spent on research/writing and more is spent on
            code :v. I'd also not have the requirement for a steady stream of commits, since that took off points
            for something that didn't really have to do with the code/project itself and more on how consistently I
            could work
            on them, which is something that would be reflected in how well the projects turned out anyway.</p>
        <p>I would nix the blog posts, since they weren't all that helpful for learning and I didn't ever really know
            what exactly I should research.
            Instead of them I might post YT videos explaining certain topics, using something like EdPuzzle. Or just
            have homework labs that supplement or expand upon the in-class labs. I learn more from coding
            than I do from reading/listening to explanations, so more focus on coding is always more beneficial for me.
        </p>
        <p>I would use Canvas in my version of the course since it's helpful for keeping up with assignment due dates.
            Keeps all the classes' assignments in one place, easy to find and remember.</p>
