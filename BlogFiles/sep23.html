        <p>Still having issues figuring out flex and position stuff (as usual), so I read an <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-positioning-and-flexbox-explained/">article</a> explaining the two. Here are some notes from that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Static is the default positioning, and it orders things in accordance to what occurs first in the HTML file.</li>
            <li>Relative positioning doesn't change anything until it's shifted up, down, left, or right.</li>
            <li>Absolute positioning causes all other elements to ignore it. Top, left, right, bottom, will shift it relative to the parent, but the parent also has to be absolute. I thought the parent had to be relative. That's what <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/">this site</a> says. Probably a mistake.</li>
            <li>Fixed ignores the parent element. It stays in the same spot on the screen, regardless of scrolling.</li>
            <li>Sticky moves but stops once it reaches the top or bottom of the screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rest of the article as stuff I pretty much already understand, nothing to note there.</p>
        <p>I think I sort of forgot that span existed, since I don't remember using it in projects. I'd just default to div instead. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/span-vs-div">this</a> page, they are "both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page", and it describes div as being a block element and span being an in-line element. I think I get the difference. Span just uses text instead of having a box with a height/width. They're just used to apply style to specific text, pretty much. I'm not sure when I'd want to use them.</p>
        <p>I wanted to look into creating an animation for the project site. My idea was to make the images slowly fade in. I tried doing it to the background image on the splash page:</p>
        <pre><code>
            .showcase {
                background-size: cover;
                background-position: center;
                height: 100vh;
                animation: fade-in 2s
            }
            
            @keyframes fade-in {
                from {
                    background-image: none;
                } 
                to {
                    background-image: url("/images/splash.jpg");
                }
            }
        </code></pre>
    <p>based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UInN6O_nMKs">this video</a> tutorial. However, this just made the dinosaur appear and disappear randomly. Not what I wanted. I don't know how to apply an opacity to just the image, since it uses background-image in the CSS file, not an img element, and I don't want to make the whole header fade in and out. Guess I'll find something else to animate.</p>
    <p>Finally, I wanted to see why dashes are used instead of camelcase for CSS, so I read this <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-are-dashes-preferred-for-css-selectors-html-attributes/">article</a>, and it just seemed to find five different ways of saying "it's more readable." Fair enough. I'm so used to camelcase though, oh well.</p>
