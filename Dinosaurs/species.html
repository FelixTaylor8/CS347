            <p>This dinosaur was determined to have feathers in 2007. It couldn't fly, but it may have used its feathers "for display, to shield nests, for temperature control, or to help it maneuver while running." It used the up-turned claws on its feet to assist in killing prey. </p>

            <p>This unique species has had only a few fossil discoveries, and the earliest ones were destroyed in WWII. With a head shaped like a crocodile's and a sail on its back, paleontologists have theorized that it fished in rivers and swamps. Recent discoveries indicate its tail was adept for wading or swimming, but this is an ongoing debate amongst scientists.</p>

            <p>This apex predator was made popular by the <a href="species.html#jp">Jurassic Park</a> franchise. It had small but strong arms and a highly adept sense of smell. There is much debate over whether or not T. rex had feathers, lips, and whether it hunted or scavenged for prey. It used to be commonly depicted as standing upright like a kangaroo, but it's understood now that its body would have been parallel to the ground, and it used its tail to balance, like many other bipedal dinosaurs.</p>

            <p>Brontosaurus is the staple example of massive dinosaurs with long necks, known as sauropods. They could feed off of trees like giraffes, but as their necks were so long, they probably couldn't hold them up high for very long, as it would have put too much strain on their hearts. In 1903, Brontosaurus was reclassified as Apatosaurus, but as of 2015, it is its own genus again.</p>
