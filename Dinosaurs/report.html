            <li>This site's audience is a general one of "people who like dinosaurs," and they can learn about them or find dinosaur movies/games.</li>
            <li>The info I used was written in my own words or quoted and sourced, and the images were all public domain/creative commons. The time period page uses lorem ipsum text because it was taking way too long to do the research for the other pages.</li>
            <li>The home page contains a form and information about what each of the pages is for. The other four are all various dino</li>
            <li>The header has the T-rex picture and the title</li>
            <li>Navigation links are at the top</li>
            <li>The t-rex disappears on a small screen, the multi-column pages turn to one column</li>
            <li>Each page uses the same header and the same gray and blue sections</li>
            <li>There are images of dinosaurs and fossils with alt tags describing them</li>
            <li>The favicon of each page is a little dinosaur cartoon</li>
            <li>Images and CSS are in their own folders, with the exception of splash.jpg, which had to go in the CSS folder as for some reason it couldn't be reached otherwise, even when I used the direct path</li>
            <li>Have not imported any libraries or frameworks</li>
            <li>Everything validates when I run it</li>
            <li>Most text is aligned to the left with the exception of some headers and links</li>
            <li>Content is confined to padded blue and gray sections</li>
            <li>Headers and nav links use Verdana, everything else uses Trebuchet</li>
            <li>The home page has a form for signing up to an imaginary newsletter</li>
            <li>There are links to YouTube videos, image sources, and information sources</li>
            <li>Code uses kebab-case and was run through auto formatters</li>
            <li>Images (besides the big t-rex) fade in and links transition to a different shade when hovered</li>
            <li>Stored on GitHub</li>
            <li>File names correct</li>
            <li>Works with https</li>
            <li>Uses port 443</li>
            <li>Redirects to https</li>
            <li>Pushed when I remembered to</li>
            <li>Report here</li>
